The Open RTLinux Patent License

Version 2.0

The Open RTLinux Patent License ("License" or :Agreement") governs the royalty-free use of the process defined by U.S. Patent No. 5,995,745. Anyone can license the use of the Patented Process (as defined below) by agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License. Such person is considered to be the Licensee ("Licensee"). The Patented Process may be used, without any payment of a royalty, with two (2) types of software. The first type is software that operates under the terms of a GPL (as defined below). The second type is software operating under an Open RTLinux Execution Environment (as defined below). As long as the Licensee complies with the terms and conditions of this License and, where applicable, with the terms of the GPL, the Licensee may continue to use the Patented Process without paying a royalty for its use. You may use the Patented Process with software other than the two types mentioned above but you must first obtain a separate license for such use. The first step is to contact Finite State Machine Labs, Inc. (http://www.fsmlabs.com)

Definitions

1. "Patented Process" means the process covered by U.S. Patent No. 5,995,745, issued November 30, 1999 and entitled ADDING REAL-TIME SUPPORT TO GENERAL PURPOSE OPERATING SYSTEMS.

2. "License" means this License in its entirety, also known as the Open RTLinux Patent License Version 2.0.

3. "Licensor" means Victor Yodaiken, the inventor and co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 5,995,745, and Finite State Machine Labs, Inc., the other co-owner of the patent.

4. "You" means any person or entity that makes use of the Patented Process or agrees to be bound by provisions of this License ("Licensee").

5. "GPL" means The Free Software Foundation's General Public License Version 2.

6. "Open RTLinux Software" means unmodified software labeled "Open RTLinux code" by Finite State Machine Labs, Inc. and:

A. In the case of a binary distribution, the complete set of executable programs, including linked files and any and all other accompanying files, such as documentation;

B. In the case of an installation for use, the complete set of executable programs, any linked files, any attached files and any and all other accompanying files, such as documentation;

C. In the case of a source distribution, the complete set of unmodified source files, and any and all documentation included with the source code.

7. "Open RTLinux Execution Environment" means: A computer hardware system where the interrupt control hardware of processors and system boards is under the direct control of unmodified Open RTLinux Software in binary form. Configuration by a Licensee using the configuration tools provided by Licensor is not considered a modification unless such configuration includes a change to Open RTLinux code that is not provided as an option through the configuration tool.

Approved Use

In addition to the other terms and conditions of this License, use of the Patented Process is permitted, without fee or royalty, when used:

A. By software licensed under the GPL; or

B. By software that executes within an Open RTLinux Execution Environment - whether that software is licensed under the GPL or not.

Your Obligation

1. Any use of the Patented Process must include labeling the product or service that includes the Patented Process with the following language: "Used, under license, U.S. Patent No. 5,995,745."

2. A copy of these conditions and terms must be attached to or included with any distribution of any product or service that uses the Patented Process. It must be made clear to anyone that uses your product or service that all subsequent uses must also comply with the conditions and terms of this License and (where appropriate) the GPL.

3. If you are using this Patented Process according to the conditions of this License for GPL software and you are distributing or otherwise making your software available outside your company then you must not place any artificial impediments to free access to your software source code. If you distribute your software or market your software through some web site on the World-Wide-Web, you must make source code for the software that makes use of the Patented Process immediately available on the World-Wide-Web for all to access. Any subsequent use must comply strictly with the terms of the GPL and with this License. Failure to comply with the terms of the GPL will result in an automatic termination of this License.

4. Open RTLinux Software is released under the GPL and you must comply with the terms of the GPL where applicable. Any modification of Open RTLinux code outside of the terms of the GPL is considered a material breach of this license. Any modification of Open RTLinux code results in code that is not "Open RTLinux code" in the terms of this license and this code cannot be used under the provisions of the section on Approved Use, subparagraph (B) above.
